    "# Homework Grading\n",
    "The goal of this is to develop a robust homework grading system which combines Google Colab + Jupyter Notebooks + GitHub Classroom + Otter Grader + Blackboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Make sure that Docker is installed and the Docker Daemon is running.  You can download Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Clone the `Otter Helper` repository from [here](https://github.com/jkuruzovich/otter_helper).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3.  Download assignment from Blackboard or GitHub and put it in the `assignments/<course>/<assignment>` directory. If you then paste your solution in this directory, it will be a good test that it was possible to get 100% on all of the tests.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Update the `/config/course/<course>.yml` file with the appropriate configuration and assignments. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. Verify that the appropriate tests and data are in the associated `config/course/assignment/` folder. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Verify that the appropriate files specified in the assignments are in the associated `config/course/files/` folder.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  7. Verify that the roster is setup in `config/course/roster.xlsx`. This includes 1 sheet which maps GitHub id to student id (if using GitHub classroom) and 1 that is a template downloaded from Blackboard. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  8. Update set the `course` and `assignment_id` varaibles in the `grade.ipynb` notebook to be consistent with the paths files downloaded and the `config.yml` file. To run the sample assignments, just keep `course` set to `sample-class` and select `blackboard` or `github-classroom` for the `assignment_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing the above, you are ready to run the `grade.ipynb` notebook.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The the next two sections of the notebook (building the Docker container and installing Otter) only need to be done once. \n"
